    This works, but The instructions say to focus on basic matching criteria.
        (age, gender, diagnosis, lab results, etc)

From TrialGPT:
"Further, the SIGIR and TREC datasets focus on the semantics of the
clinical trial inclusion/exclusion criteria, excluding factors such as
geolocation and trial recruitment status as these are addressable
through traditional structured query approaches. As a result, any use
of TrialGPT would similarly need to ensure the identified trials are
appropriate for a patient along these lines as well."

TrialGPT doesn't do this. That is what we're doing here.



Now i'm trying to make a sqlite database and using the following:
